I drew the lines with a simple pressure sensitive pen, then colored it using the same pen. The colors and background were rendered and run through filters until I liked it. I tried to keep the colors simple enough and avoid too much detail, like grain or noise, to keep the file size down-ish. It ended up being about 9MB. Some of my arts are like 30MB so I think I did a good job with this one.</p>",
