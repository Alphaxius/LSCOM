Not because I don't know how or I was too lazy to write the script (I think writing the script would have been easier) but because I enjoyed making that table. I thought multiplying those numbers in my head was fun for some reason.</p><p>Anyway, the reason I made that table at all was really because I felt I needed practice multiplying numbers this morning, while making my coffee. I use a ratio of 1:16 coffee weight to water weight in, and I ground 13 grams of beans. I needed to multiply 13 by 16. Okay, 100, 90, 18, 208. Great. Easy enough. <i>But what if</i>, I thought to myself, <i>what if I just knew what 13 by 16 was.</i> Maybe that would take the fun out of multiplying. (Something something suffer for different problems I'm reading <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i> by Mark Manson at the moment). So anyway. Now this table is on the internet.</p><p>While making this table I was reminded how much I enjoy the composition of numbers. Like, 144. One of my favorite numbers. Always get excited when I see it in the wild. Its factors are 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3. This makes for some fun things. 144=12^2*<hovertext>1^2#trivial</hovertext>, 144=2^2*6^2, 144=4^2*3^2. It's combinatorics and composit numbers all together, fantastic. Another fun, but larger one is 900. There's a vSauce video about these somewhere? Anti-primes I think. Like 5040, another good one. Someone on Wikipedia wrote this about it: '5040 is a factorial (7!), a superior highly composite number, abundant number, colossally abundant number and the number of permutations of 4 items out of 10 choices (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 = 5040). It is also one less than a square, making (7, 71) a Brown number pair.'</p>",
