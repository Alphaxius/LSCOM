      "content": "<p>Whenever I bake cookies, I put them in a shallow tin on top of the fridge. There is a cabinet very close to the top of the fridge, so it has to be shallow. For some reason this brings me a lot of comfort. I don't know what it is about it, maybe it's humbling knowing that I otherwise don't have enough space for cookies anywhere else. Maybe it's nostalgia for when I was a kid and we stored stuff on top of the fridge. Though, that wasn't cookies. Nor was it cereal boxes, as I've been told is the standard thing to keep on top of your fridge.</p><p>Right now I have some <hovertext>hershey kisses#which I am calling cookies and you cannot stop me</hovertext> and some gluten free and vegan biscotti which need to be thrown out. I am working on a recipe for that but with cookies it is important to know how they stale. My chocolate chip cookie recipe includes an optional ingredient corn starch, which if you add it makes it much better the day of, but it stales way faster than if you skip it. I also had some speculaas that my mom made during the holidays. It's a family recipe that I'm proud to be a part of <hovertext>occasionally#I have missed the last few years</hovertext>. I'm hoping some time this weekend to make some more cookies, but I'm still recovering from being <hovertext>sick and sad#probably the flu, I tested negative for COVID and the symptoms don't match RSV or strep</hovertext>.</p><p>Other things I don't have space for include the chips and snacks on my floor outside of the pantry, and the folding chairs that are currently outside of my bathroom. I think I need to rearrange again to try to fit everything in. I want to get rid of stuff but almost everything I own gets used at least <hovertext>once a year#some of it is holiday stuff</hovertext>.</p>",
