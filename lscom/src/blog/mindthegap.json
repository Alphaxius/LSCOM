It's very annoying having itchy eyes whenever I am inside some old apartment that has a lot of moisture, like any apartment in Seattle. Then my asthma came back! So I temporarily moved back to my moms, an hour and a half commmute to work doot doot. THEN I found an apartment! So I'm moving. And work has been busy. And my car still needs to be fixed. I would love 4 more hours in the day. <hovertext>\"Praying to G-d\"#Barf from Spaceballs</hovertext>. I also have been on a new medication because of shortages. Oh I also broke one of my fillings, and I'm getting a new crown, so my mouth feels weird. Then WHAM BAM I accidentally reset my Chromebook that I develop this website on. Because I had it in developer mode for no reason really, and I was tired, and I've developed a habit of automatically resetting Chromebooks from work (I work as a k12 sys admin). But anyway, I had to set up my development environment again. No fancy IDEs, just setting up git credentials and python and whatnots. So there's the rant. More content, hopefully coming soon. In the mean time, I'm moving and resting. And attempting to breathe so much.</p><p>I hope whoever comes across this enjoys reading all of this random stuff that I'm doing. And if you are checking my average post rate, I think I am behind at this point in time. But, this is a hobby, and life stuff does come first. Gotta keep those light bulbs balanced, right CGP Gray Grey? I like the light bulb analogy. Good analogy.</p>",
