      "content": "<p>I did this right after I posted the picture, I sent it the link to my art and asked it to criticize the piece. Honestly, I think these are good critiques. To be honest, the piece isn't my favorite. I'm not the best with using the little pen tablet that I have, I think I'm better with a regular pen.</p><p>Anyway, today is a few days later. I'm still thinking about this wacky thing. It's pretty cool imo, but I don't really know what to think. I feel like I should have some profound idea of what this means for the future but, I think honestly this just seems like a tool that we all will need to learn how to use. Like how we all learned to use a word processor and most of us learned to use excel. I think this is a lot closer to a word processor in terms of scale of impact. If anything though I think it's very scary how much the thing can do and how little we know about what it's doing. Crossing my fingers the engineers don't do it too stupid lol</p>",

      "content": "<p>I think your art is very good and I don't have any major critiques. If I had to give you some suggestions for improvement, I would say:</p><p>- You could try to vary the size and shape of the geometric elements to create more interest and diversity in your composition. For example, you could use smaller triangles for the distant mountains and larger ones for the foreground. You could also use different shapes for the clouds, such as circles or hexagons.</p><p>- You could try to add some details or textures to your geometric elements to make them more realistic and expressive. For example, you could use dots or lines to create shadows or highlights on the mountain or the sun. You could also use gradients or patterns to create different effects on the sky or the clouds.</p><p>- You could try to experiment with different color schemes or combinations to create different moods or atmospheres in your artwork. For example, you could use warmer colors for a sunrise or sunset scene, or cooler colors for a night scene. You could also use complementary colors for contrast, or analogous colors for harmony.</p><p>These are just some ideas that you might want to try out in your future artworks. But remember that art is subjective and there is no right or wrong way to do it. The most important thing is that you enjoy what you do and express yourself creatively.\ud83d\ude0a</p>",
